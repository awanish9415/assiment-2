1_What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?


ANSWER 


The Boolean data type has two possible values: True and False?
In Python , these values are written with an uppercase T and F, respectively. For example:
x = True
y = False
Boolean values are often used in programming to represent the truth or falsity of a statement or condition. 
For example, you might use a Boolean value to check whether a number is positive or negative, 
or to determine if a string is empty or not.

2_What are the three different types of Boolean operators?

ANS

Boolean operators are used to perform logical operations on Boolean values (True and False). There are three main Boolean operators in Python
and: The and operator returns True if both operands are True, and False if either operand is False. For example:
True and True  # Returns True
True and False  # Returns False
False and True  # Returns False
False and False  # Returns False

3_Make a list of each Boolean operator&#39;s truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
values for the operator and what it evaluate ).?

Here are the truth tables for the three Boolean operators in Python:

and operator:
Operand 1	Operand 2	Result
True	True	True
True	False	False
False	True	False
False	False	False

or operator:
Operand 1	Operand 2	Result
True	True	True
True	False	True
False	True	True
False	False	False

not operator:
Operand	Result
True	False
False	True

4_What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
not (5 > 4)
(5 >4) or (3 == 5)
not ((5> 4) or (3 == 5))
(True and True) and (True == False)
(not False) or (not True)

ANS
Here are the values of the following expressions:


(5 > 4) and (3 == 5): This expression evaluates to False. The first operand (5 > 4) is True, but the second operand (3 == 5) is False, so the and operator returns False.
not (5 > 4): This expression evaluates to False. The operand (5 > 4) is True, so the not operator returns the opposite, which is False.
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5): This expression evaluates to True. The first operand (5 > 4) is True, so the or operator returns True without evaluating the second operand.
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)): This expression evaluates to False. The operand ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) is True, so the not operator returns the opposite, which is False.
(True and True) and (True == False): This expression evaluates to False. The first operand (True and True) is True, but the second operand (True == False) is False, so the and operator returns False.
(not False) or (not True): This expression evaluates to True. The operand `(not False)

5_What are the six comparison operators?
ANS

There are six comparison operators in Python:

==: This operator checks if two values are equal. It returns True if the values are equal, and False if they are not. For example:
x = 2
y = 3
x == y  # Returns False
!=: This operator checks if two values are not equal. It returns True if the values are not equal, and False if they are equal. For example:
x = 2
y = 3
x != y  # Returns True
>: This operator checks if one value is greater than another. It returns True if the first value is greater than the second, and False if it is not. For example:
x = 2
y = 3
x > y  # Returns False
<: This operator checks if one value is less than another. It returns True if the first value is less than the second, and False if it is not. For example:
x = 2
y = 3
x < y  # Returns True
>=: This operator checks if one value is greater than or equal to another. It returns True if the first value is greater than or equal to the second, and False if it is not. For example:
Copy code
x = 2
y = 3
x >= y  # Returns False
<=: This operator checks if one value is less than or equal to another. It returns True if the first value is less than or equal to the second, and False if it is not. For example:
Copy code
x = 2
y = 3
x <= y  # Returns True

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one?

ANS

There are two different operators that can look similar at first glance: the equal to operator == and the assignment operator =. 
It's important to understand the difference between these two operators,
because using the wrong one can lead to errors or unintended consequences in your code.
Here is how you can tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators:
Equal to operator ==: This operator is used to compare two values and determine if they are equal. 
It returns True if the values are equal, and False if they are not. For example:
x = 2
y = 3
x == y  # Returns False
x = 2  # Assigns the value 2 to the variable x
y = 3  # Assigns the value 3 to the variable y

7_Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print(&#39;eggs&#39;)
if spam &gt; 5:
print(&#39;bacon&#39;)
else:
print(&#39;ham&#39;)
print(&#39;spam&#39;)
print(&#39;spam&#39;)

ANS
In the given code, there are three blocks:

1_The first block is the block of code indented under the if spam == 10: line. This block consists of the print('eggs') line.

2_The second block is the block of code indented under the if spam > 5: line. This block consists of the print('bacon') line.

3_The third block is the block of code indented under the else: line. This block consists of the print('ham') line.

In Python, blocks of code are defined by their indentation level. Each line of code indented at the same level is part of the same block.

8_Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

ANS 

if spam == 1:
    print('Hello')
elif spam == 2:
    print('Howdy')
else:
    print('Greetings!')
    
9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
ANS 

If your program is stuck in an endless loop, you can use the following keys to terminate the program and stop the loop:

CTRL + C: On most systems, pressing CTRL + C will interrupt the program and terminate it. This is a good option if you want to stop the program immediately.

CTRL + Z: On Windows systems, pressing CTRL + Z will suspend the program and return you to the command prompt. You can then use the fg command to resume the program, or the kill command to terminate it.

CTRL + D: On Unix-like systems (such as Linux and Mac OS), pressing CTRL + D will send an end-of-file (EOF) signal to the program, which may cause it to terminate.

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
 ANS 
 break and continue are keywords that are used to control the flow of a loop. While they both affect the way a loop executes, they have different effects on the loop and are used in different situations.

Here is how you can tell the difference between break and continue:

Break: The break keyword is used to exit a loop prematurely. When a break statement is encountered inside a loop, the loop is immediately terminated and the program continues with the next statement after the loop.
For example:
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)

In this code, the loop will iterate 10 times, but it will stop and exit the loop when i is equal to 5. The output of this code will be 0 1 2 3 4.

Continue: The continue keyword is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration.
When a continue statement is encountered inside a loop, the program continues with the next iteration of the loop, 
Skipping any remaining statements in the current iteration. For example:
for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(i)

In this code, the loop will iterate 10 times, but it will skip the rest of the current iteration and move on to the next iteration whenever i is an even number.
The output of this code will be 1 3 5 7 9.

11_In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
ANS 

the range() function is used to generate a sequence of numbers. When used in a for loop, it allows you to iterate over the generated sequence. The range() function takes three arguments: start, stop, and step.

range(10): This generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 9, with a step size of 1. When used in a for loop, it will iterate 10 times.

range(0, 10): This generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 9, with a step size of 1. When used in a for loop, it will iterate 10 times. This is equivalent to range(10).

range(0, 10, 1): This generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 9, with a step size of 1. When used in a for loop, it will iterate 10 times. This is equivalent to range(10).

So, in terms of the sequence of numbers generated, there is no difference between these three calls to range().
They all generate the same sequence of numbers from 0 to 9, with a step size o

12_Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
ANS
Here is a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop:
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)

And here is an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop:
i = 1
while i <= 10:
    print(i)
    i += 1
Both of these programs will output the numbers 1 to 10, one number per line.
The first program uses a for loop to iterate over a sequence of numbers generated by the range() function, 
while the second program uses a while loop to count from 1 to 10 using a loop variable i.

13_If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
importing spam?


If you have a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, and you want to call the function after importing the module,
you can do so using the following syntax:

import spam

spam.bacon()

This will import the spam module, and then call the bacon() function from the module.

Alternatively, you can use the following syntax to import the bacon() function directly:


from spam import bacon

bacon()

This will import the bacon() function directly, allowing you to call it without using the module name.
